    - Include a sprinkling of 'why do this with triples?' / 'why triples are cool!' type slides
   - Do a query that you can't do in relational / document search alone -> Idea of context, defining the 'relationship' not just the presence of data
  - Manually define a new triple (mention we'll suggest triples in the future) for a XHTML document
   - Includes setting up your own ontology in the semanticcontext object
   - Include 'automatically link root entity back to document' via documentcontext object (to be created)

   - Show the new query, and that the same answers are produced
  - Avoiding sparql/xquery inferencing
   - Is there a navigation process possible via existing widgets that would allow you to discover all related subjects and information you need, and produce a report off of the back of it?
   - Embed BI type summaries too? (E.g. facet graphs from document query results)
  - Sparql 1.1 in MarkLogic 7
   - Show what parts of the spec are there, and which ones we're missing, but which ones *can* be provided with a little work
   - Inferencing - we've shown, but should mention here
   - aggregates (count, sum, avg, etc.)
  
Targets for 1.4 (Feb 2014)
 - CSS best practice
  - Use variables where it makes sense (title height, padding, etc.)
  - minimise property name length and collisions with other css by using ``.mljswidget .docproperties {  .title {}  .name {} ... }`` style of CSS declarations
  - Rejig H tags to be at a lower level (searchresults h5, subtitle h4, title h3) - leaves space for page title (h1) and panel/tab title (h2), and extra in widget title. E.g. search property value (h6)
  - IN PROGRESS create generic classes for all widgets
   - DONE title
   - subtitle
   - listtitle (E.g. for search results, sparql subjects, other dynamically drawn h4 type tags)
   - highlight
   - selected
 - JavaScript best practices / conventions
  - IN PROGRESS use var max = whatever.length in for loops - between 2 and 150 times faster than accessing the DOM on each iteration
   - DONE Sparql (triple) widgets
   - Search widgets
   - Core
   - Highcharts
  - underscores for private functions
  - NA _configuration json object for Workplace compatible widgets/contexts
  - UpperCamelCase for constructors/objects
  - IN PROGRESS lowerCamelCase for functions (searchcontext and mljs have some alllowercase methods)
  - DONE Using Factory pattern. See mljs.create*() methods. Changed mljs.defaultconnection in core MLJS to instead access parent MLJS instance
  - DONE Using logger mixin. Logger's attached to DB, so have had to link tripleconfig to creating db via factory method. keep tripleconfig separate from core MLJS instantiator (as it never requires a connection to use), but allow a way to specify a logger and check for this (to avoid defaultconnection.logger)
  - DONE better way to access logging functionality by default - define _i(), _d() prototype methods for each subobject? Via a core mixin utility func? 
   - DONE (Could use same mechanism to provide correct 'this' reference from constructor function.)
   - DONE Using mljs.create*() factory methods. Have mljs.prototype. constructor functions add a db property pointer to all created children
  - NA Using factory pattern instead. Add check in constructor functions to ensure if not called via new MyObject(), that it returns a new instance anyway (location 1051)
  - Double check isArray function definition for best practice (location 1110) - also check for splice()
  - IN PROGRESS Done this for tripleconfig, not widgets and their contexts. Use self defining functions for lazy loading (E.g. semantic context creation), and any requiring extensive initialisation (Sparql widget?) (location 1515)
  - Memoization (cache) pattern applied to sparql facts (location 1702)
  - Apply Currying when calling the same function with mostly same parameters (if costly) (location 1860)
  - Use Module pattern and closures to hide internal properties/private methods (location 2117) but with constructors (2139)
  - DONE using for logging mixin on context objects. Apply Borrow and Bind pattern (mixin for functions) where applicable (to avoid any inheritance temptations) (location 2922)
  - Apply Data Validation pattern to 'create' widget (When new functionality added - may be V 1.2?) (location 3254)
  - Find a better way to restrict what parts of the logging output are set to use debug (Perhaps a mixin to objects with lazy initialisation based on debug level specified, if any)
  - Use more high order functions (callbacks, replacing functionality within otherwise identical loops)
  - DONE Check for 'innerHTML += ' and replace with appendChild and temporary div trick
  - Perform JavaScript profiling in FireBug (again) to check for issues
 - Detect V7 (HEAD to a V7 only endpoint?)
 - Auto install of extensions referenced by MLJS core via PUT /v1/ext endpoint

 - DONE Minor fixes
  - DONE Remove debug logging for every value in charts
 - DONE Samples: Sample triples, linked content, working sparql query builder
 - DONE Widgets: Semantic rearchitecting
  - DONE addTriplesListener to replace addResultsListener
