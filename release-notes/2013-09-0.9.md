# Release Notes - Version 0.9 - September 2013

Highlights of this release:-
- RDB2RDF REST Extension and widget - for importing relational data direct in to MarkLogic 7's triple store
- SPARQL query widget - various improvements, including auto complete, less than/greater than support for numeric fields, linking to content directly from sparql results list
- Added a 'contribute' mode to searchbar and semanticcontext objects so they can both 'contribute' rather than replace structured search query terms to the same content context (May become the default in future)

Other minor improvements:-
- Ensured sparql results use DISTINCT to remove any duplicate results
- Added bootstrap.js support to semantic widgets, and started rationalising the CSS classes used to increase consistency and reduce CSS bloat
- Removed logging on every 'row' during HighCharts graph display, to increase speed
- Changed updateResults to updateTriples for semantic results handlers so that widgets (E.g. Kratu) can draw both content results and semantic results without complex method data detection
